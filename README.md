```

(4) Do not be concerned about precise spacing of input / output.  Input the length of the base of a triangle and its height. Output the area with one decimal place.

```
Enter the Base Length (meters):           35.5
Enter the Height (meters):                17.2

The Area is (square meters):             305.3
```

(5) For the following program, design your I/O so that it closely matches the example.  An elevator company needs a program that allows it to enter two numbers:
 * the lifting capacity of an elevator
 * the average weight of an adult
They need to know how many adults can be safely ride in the elevator.

```
       Way-to-Go Elevators and Lifts
Enter Elevator Lifting Capacity (pounds): 1600
Enter Average Adult Weight (pounds): 180

Safe Capacity:  8  Adults
```

(6) For the following program, design your I/O so that it closely matches the example.  A donut shop needs to determine how many boxes it will need for a batch of donuts. Each box contains a dozen donuts. In addition, any extra donuts (those that don't make up a full dozen) are to be given to the Food Bank. Input the number of donuts in the batch of donuts. Output the number of boxes needed and the number of donuts to be sent to the Food Bank.

```
        Krazytime Donuts
Enter Number of Donuts:	931

Number of Boxes Needed: 77
Number of Donuts to the Food Bank: 7
```

(7) For the following program, design your I/O so that it closely matches the example.  Input a number of cents. Convert this into an equivalent amount of change in quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

```
        Changer 1
Enter Number of Cents:	931

Number of Quarters: 37
Number of Dimes:     0
Number of Nickels:   1
Number of Pennies:   1
```

(8) For the following program, design your I/O so that it closely matches the example.  Input a number of cents. Convert this into an equivalent amount of change in twenties, tens, fives, twos, ones, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

```
        Changer 2
Enter Number of Cents:	14968

Number of Twenties:  7
Number of Tens:      0
Number of Fives:     1
Number of Twos:      2
Number of Ones:      0
Number of Quarters:  2
Number of Dimes:     1
Number of Nickels:   1
Number of Pennies:   3
```

(9) For the following program, design your I/O so that it closely matches the example.  Input a number of inches. Convert this into an equivalent amount of miles, yards, feet and inches. There are 1760 yards in a mile, 3 feet in a yard, and 12 inches in a foot.

```
        Changer 3
Enter Number of inches:	138451

Number of Miles:            2
Number of Yards:          325
Number of Feet:             2
Number of Inches:           7
```
